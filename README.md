- __Experience Modals__
  - The image modal functionality allows me to display writing in a hidden container which is triggered by the interactive click of the images, this provides a good       break between wrtiting and allows me to isolate and indivially list and talk about different experience and organise them based on catagory, this provides the user     the choice of what information is shown to them at one time. the user is able to close the popup modal through a button, icon and offclick.

    - the sidebar functionality adds an extra layer of navigation for the user allowing them to navigate through the website if the functionality of the main navbar        fails,whilst also displaying the relevent content such as the website logo and a contact me button that links to my personal email, this allows users to                personally send any queries. underneath the icons for social media directs the user to the relevent social media website. the function is triggered by the click        event of the hamburger icon which is fixed on the top left.

- __About me__
    - This section is clearly labbeled with vertically alligned head which allows for continuity onto the next section however this also allows the information and           images in the firgures to be easily visibly by the user. The user would be able to clearly see the related images and text. the differece in color change in          accordance to the theme of the website captivates the users attention.

- __Gallery__
    - As the user gets further down the page, they will be introduced to the infinite scrollable gallery, this adds to the continuity of the website and consistency in     the design and user interface, it will allow the user to view the entire gallery of photographs whilst at a fixed point in the website. the scrollbar is hidden to      improve user experiance and usability.

- __Footer__
   - To keep my website up to date and prevent plagerism the footer includes the copyright claim as well as the year the website was built, this will prevents copies      and plagerism however it allows for the user to establish the age of the website and the compatibility to new technology or language. the footer also has the added functionality to navigate through the website despite being in the footer this allows the users an additional navigational structure in case of malfunction or the loading error of another section of navigation.

- __Extra Functionality__
    - A design flaw of a single scrolling page is the lack of functionality to allow the user to quickly reach the top of the webpage without the need to scroll. The       up arrow button on the bottom left of the page is fixed to allow the user to navigate back to the top at the click of a button.

 ### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- The [Results](https://github.com/adzz7867/AdnanBashir/blob/main/validated-code%20(2).odt)
### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
