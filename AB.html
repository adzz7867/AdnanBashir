            <h4> Developer / Teacher Nov 2017 – July 2018</h4>
            <h5>Digilab Tooting 89 Bickersteth Rd, London SW17 9SH</h5>
            <p><i>During my college education in the pursuit of acquiring a level 3 extended diploma in ict, i had to
                  complete a mandatory week of work experiance. Whilst searching for such work experiance i stumbled
                  across the only web development work placement out of the long list of different job varieties. I
                  took
                  my chances and rather then spending the week as a cashier or libary assistant i gladly decided to
                  go
                  for it! . I was honestly not expecting much however i was abruptly proven wrong the experiance,
                  knowledge,friends and lessons i have learnt from the nine months i spent there which greatly
                  influenced
                  and impacted and sparked the passion i have for coding and programming, this could be considered
                  the
                  birth of my web develpoment career. Before i had taken the course i had already been intresting in
                  programming software and building hardware like pcs. However my mind was quickly changed in the
                  first
                  day of going, i was blown away at how the websites i have been seeing my whole life are made and i
                  was
                  there learning to do it myself. Througout the week i was taught taught the basics of html and css
                  and
                  immediatly my intrest had peaked, even though html is easy i was fascinated by the endless
                  possabilites of what i could with this new found <strong>superpower! </strong>. My young and
                  creative
                  mind became extatic and wild with curiosity and working alongside all my other classmates who
                  <strong>obviously</strong> decided to do this work placement rather then the other ones aswell
                  helped
                  support and excel my growth and learning. After a week of hard work and frustration i had completed
                  the work placement, but for me it wast the end to my journey with Digilab. i was offered to stay on
                  as
                  a web developer helping create websites for cleints using my basic knowledge and tools like
                  wordpress
                  whilst also teaching what i had recently learnt to the younger generation programmers and web
                  developers. During this experiance the skills i learnt and had to use were:</i> </p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
               <li>• Meet with and understand requirements of the client.</li>
               <li>• Being able to organise and work in a co-ordinated manner with colleagues on a project and be
                  able to communicate and complete the project to a high standard.</li>
               <li> • Being able to explain to and teach children of all ages about web development and
                  strengthening their knowledge of it</li>
               <li> • Organising and planning lessons</li>
               <li>• Being versatile and knowledgeable in order to make the website to the exact specification in
                  which the client requires.</li>
               <li> • Been able to communicate to colleagues and students if they need assistance and work in a
                  group to solve the problem.</li>

            <h4>Full stack Web Developer Bootcamp December 2022 – April 2023</h4>
            <h5> Amberley Road London W9 2JJ</h5>
            <p>After a long drought of what seemed to be like forever since i had touched web develpoment came an
               oppertunity which really was a once in a genration, The government was subsidicing courses left and
               right and whilst there was plenty to choose from the unique experiance i had whilst taking the code
               institute full stack web development course was inspiring, being around individuals that shared the
               same interest and a comradary which i could not have found anywhere else. the feeling of a productive
               and vibrant enviroment was the perfect breeding ground for creative minds to thrive. i can say with
               confindence i thrived not only because of my individual intelect, but the combined harmonization of
               knowledge to atttribute towards a goal, learning or re-learning some of theese
               languages was a struggle and a <strong>headache</strong> at times however, when times were rough you
               could always count on your mentor and colleagues. i had tough times however i can say this course has
               greatly benifited me and was worth the tough times. Some skills i had to impliment when taking this
               course was:</p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
               <li>•understand requirements of the course and complete the designated task.</li>
               <li> • Being able to organise my time and work in a co-ordinated manner with my tutor on a project and
                  be
                  able to communicate and complete the project to a satisfactory standard.</li>
               <li>• Being able to explain the knowledge aquired and convey the understanding of the knowledge i have
                  gained by creating a website with the given django language
                  specification(html,css,javascript,bootstrap 5)</li>
               <li>• practicing versatility and being knowledgeable to make the website to the highest standard in
                  which
                  the website would meet the requirments of the specification.</li>
               <li>• communicate to colleagues or tutor and work together to quickly and efficiently resolve any
                  queries
                  and troubleshoot issues.</li>

               at TGI Fridays Wembley. it was a short employment however i ganined vital experiance with
               running a
               station, the time managment and repetitive consistency that i was subjected to made me a more
               efficient and analytical thinker. alongside making good memories with the other people working
               there i learnt many important skills that helped develop me into a more confident and assertive
               person, i had taken the skills i learnt in the kitchen and applied them to my life. this helped
               me
               realize the strong points and weaknesses and improve on them. i recieved valuable knowledge and
               insights to the workings of a professional kitchen to the industry health standards such as:</i>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
               <li>• Check the quality of the product and make sure that it meets the standards for consumer use

               <li>• Determine how food should be presented and decorative food displays</li>
               <li> • Communication with fellow peers and gained the importance of time management and
                  quality control.</li>

            <h4>Library Volunteer Aug 2017 – Sept 2017
            </h4>
            <h5>Pollards Hill Library S Lodge Ave, Mitcham CR4 1LT</h5>


            <i> As part of NCS the challenge i voluntered at a local library to help inspire and bring awareness
               to the decline of kids who read books as everything is digital, it affects the amount of people who
               use/read physical books. This programme encouraged and rewarded kids for the amount of books they
               read.my voluntering was to be able to comunicate and work with the kids who would read the book
               they were currently reading. i would be asking questions to make sure they understood
               what they are reading and giving them their star which they collect. i took part in this
               voluntering specificaly because i loved reading books myself growing up and understand the benifit
               it has, so helping to inspire the younger generation rediscover the adventure and imagination of
               reading was a no brainer. whilst i was not helping kids i was helping around the library and learnt
               how the books checking system worked to help visitors of the library out with any book returning
               queries which
               lead me to learning more about the computer systems they implemented to help with queries of
               visitors in the computer section.This expanded my knowledge in many ways as i had learnt important
               communication skills such as listening attentivley, communicating in a calm and friendly manner to
               build rapport with the child and parent. </i>
            <p>Skills implemented</p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">

               <li>• Organise and rearrange books</li>

               <i>over the years i had gained hands on experiance in the painting and decorating/building work and
                  through some mutual connections i was able to secure a spot as a painter decorator and cleanup
                  crew.
                  it was something i not only enjoyed but grew quite fond of as it was a way to focus my creative
                  talents and hone them through hard physical labour. i was fortunate during this time to learn alot
                  of
                  useful things such as:
                  how to use and opertae a jackhammer
                  to pipe plumbing
                  to take out and replaster walls and floor boards
                  grout bathroom tiles
                  the rigourous cleaning process when working in a residential apartment.
                  removing and disposing of rubble
                  dismantaling frames
                  painting in tight spaces and effectively
               </i>
