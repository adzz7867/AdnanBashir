        <h4> Developer / Teacher Nov 2017 – July 2018</h4>
        <h5>Digilab Tooting 89 Bickersteth Rd, London SW17 9SH</h5>
        <p><i>During my college education in the pursuit of acquiring a level 3 extended diploma in ict, i had to
            complete a mandatory week of work experiance. Whilst searching for such work experiance i stumbled
            across the only web development work placement out of the long list of different job varieties. I
            took
            my chances and rather then spending the week as a cashier or libary assistant i gladly decided to
            go
            for it! . I was honestly not expecting much however i was abruptly proven wrong the experiance,
            knowledge,friends and lessons i have learnt from the nine months i spent there which greatly
            influenced
            and impacted and sparked the passion i have for coding and programming, this could be considered
            the
            birth of my web develpoment career. Before i had taken the course i had already been intresting in
            programming software and building hardware like pcs. However my mind was quickly changed in the
            first
            day of going, i was blown away at how the websites i have been seeing my whole life are made and i
            was
            there learning to do it myself. Througout the week i was taught taught the basics of html and css
            and
            immediatly my intrest had peaked, even though html is easy i was fascinated by the endless
            possabilites of what i could with this new found <strong>superpower! </strong>. My young and
            creative
            mind became extatic and wild with curiosity and working alongside all my other classmates who
            <strong>obviously</strong> decided to do this work placement rather then the other ones aswell
            helped
            support and excel my growth and learning. After a week of hard work and frustration i had completed
            the work placement, but for me it wast the end to my journey with Digilab. i was offered to stay on
            as
            a web developer helping create websites for cleints using my basic knowledge and tools like
            wordpress
            whilst also teaching what i had recently learnt to the younger generation programmers and web
            developers. During this experiance the skills i learnt and had to use were:</i> </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li>• Meet with and understand requirements of the client.</li>
          <li>• Being able to organise and work in a co-ordinated manner with colleagues on a project and be
            able to communicate and complete the project to a high standard.</li>
          <li> • Being able to explain to and teach children of all ages about web development and
            strengthening their knowledge of it</li>
          <li> • Organising and planning lessons</li>
          <li>• Being versatile and knowledgeable in order to make the website to the exact specification in
            which the client requires.</li>
          <li> • Been able to communicate to colleagues and students if they need assistance and work in a
            group to solve the problem.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Full stack Web Developer Bootcamp December 2022 – April 2023</h4>
        <h5> Amberley Road London W9 2JJ</h5>
        <p>After a long drought of what seemed to be like forever since i had touched web develpoment came an
          oppertunity which really was a once in a genration, The government was subsidicing courses left and
          right and whilst there was plenty to choose from the unique experiance i had whilst taking the code
          institute full stack web development course was inspiring, being around individuals that shared the
          same interest and a comradary which i could not have found anywhere else. the feeling of a productive
          and vibrant enviroment was the perfect breeding ground for creative minds to thrive. i can say with
          confindence i thrived not only because of my individual intelect, but the combined harmonization of
          knowledge to atttribute towards a goal, learning or re-learning some of theese
          languages was a struggle and a <strong>headache</strong> at times however, when times were rough you
          could always count on your mentor and colleagues. i had tough times however i can say this course has
          greatly benifited me and was worth the tough times. Some skills i had to impliment when taking this
          course was:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li>•understand requirements of the course and complete the designated task.</li>
          <li> • Being able to organise my time and work in a co-ordinated manner with my tutor on a project and
            be
            able to communicate and complete the project to a satisfactory standard.</li>
          <li>• Being able to explain the knowledge aquired and convey the understanding of the knowledge i have
            gained by creating a website with the given django language
            specification(html,css,javascript,bootstrap 5)</li>
          <li>• practicing versatility and being knowledgeable to make the website to the highest standard in
            which
            the website would meet the requirments of the specification.</li>
          <li>• communicate to colleagues or tutor and work together to quickly and efficiently resolve any
            queries
            and troubleshoot issues.</li>

        <i> Growing up i became entruiged by cooking from my family and during my secondary school days i had

          year the resturant worked well and i was learning new techniques and dishes every week and during
          the
          experiance we had the oppertunity to cook a buffet for over 100 people and whilst it was a long
          hard

        <i>in the heart of the pandemic whilst studying i started employment as a kitchen assistant(line

          at TGI Fridays Wembley. it was a short employment however i ganined vital experiance with
          running a
          station, the time managment and repetitive consistency that i was subjected to made me a more
          efficient and analytical thinker. alongside making good memories with the other people working
          there i learnt many important skills that helped develop me into a more confident and assertive
          person, i had taken the skills i learnt in the kitchen and applied them to my life. this helped
          me
          realize the strong points and weaknesses and improve on them. i recieved valuable knowledge and

        <h4>Library Volunteer Aug 2017 – Sept 2017
        </h4>
        <h5>Pollards Hill Library S Lodge Ave, Mitcham CR4 1LT</h5>


        <i> As part of NCS the challenge i voluntered at a local library to help inspire and bring awareness
          to the decline of kids who read books as everything is digital, it affects the amount of people who
          use/read physical books. This programme encouraged and rewarded kids for the amount of books they
          read.my voluntering was to be able to comunicate and work with the kids who would read the book
          they were currently reading. i would be asking questions to make sure they understood
          what they are reading and giving them their star which they collect. i took part in this
          voluntering specificaly because i loved reading books myself growing up and understand the benifit
          it has, so helping to inspire the younger generation rediscover the adventure and imagination of
          reading was a no brainer. whilst i was not helping kids i was helping around the library and learnt
          how the books checking system worked to help visitors of the library out with any book returning
          queries which
          lead me to learning more about the computer systems they implemented to help with queries of
          visitors in the computer section.This expanded my knowledge in many ways as i had learnt important
          communication skills such as listening attentivley, communicating in a calm and friendly manner to
          build rapport with the child and parent. </i>
        <p>Skills implemented</p>

          <i>over the years i had gained hands on experiance in the painting and decorating/building work and
            through some mutual connections i was able to secure a spot as a painter decorator and cleanup
            crew.
            it was something i not only enjoyed but grew quite fond of as it was a way to focus my creative
            talents and hone them through hard physical labour. i was fortunate during this time to learn alot
            of
            useful things such as:
            how to use and opertae a jackhammer
            to pipe plumbing
            to take out and replaster walls and floor boards
            grout bathroom tiles
            the rigourous cleaning process when working in a residential apartment.
            removing and disposing of rubble
            dismantaling frames
            painting in tight spaces and effectively
          </i>
